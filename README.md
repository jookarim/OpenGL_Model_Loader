# Shadow_Mapping_OpenGL

A modern OpenGL project demonstrating **real-time shadow mapping** using both
**directional lights** and **point lights**, rendered on a 3D cube scene with
**Blinn–Phong lighting**.

The project implements:
- Directional shadow mapping using depth maps
- Omnidirectional (point light) shadow mapping using cube depth maps
- Blinn–Phong lighting model for realistic diffuse and specular shading
- Clean separation between CPU-side data and GPU resources
- Modern OpenGL practices (core profile, explicit buffer usage)

This project is designed as a **foundational graphics portfolio piece**,
focusing on correctness, clarity, and extensibility toward more advanced
rendering techniques.
